# calender
It is my first java based GUI program. The main intention behind this project was to learn java.

### Features 
Tried to make a calendar whose design is inspired from wall calendar. Where users can change 
month back and forth as well as for year. People can jump any month of any year and come back to current date by simply mouse clicking.
